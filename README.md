# The Group Income Challenge

### What you need to do:

- Make the full-screen modal open and close (the page where you open it is not very relevant, it can just be a blank page with a button that says "Open Settings");
- Selecting a different color theme should immediately change the colors in the screen;
- The text-size slider should be "slideable", but it doesn't need to make it actually change the size of the text in the platform â€” if you choose to do that you will get bonus points if it does well.
- The root folder of the project should contain a "dist" folder with an index.html file in it that can be opened locally in any browser (Safari, Firefox, and Chrome). It should also contain all of the source files necessary for generating that file.
- (Optional) Feel free to add micro-interactions or other behaviours not described in the exercise/mockups.

### Structure of the repository

- /dist folder contains `index.html`

### Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
